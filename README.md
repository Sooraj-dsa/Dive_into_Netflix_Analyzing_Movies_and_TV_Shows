Founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph, Netflix emerged as a DVD rental-by-mail service, revolutionizing the way people rented movies. At the time, late fees for video rentals were a common frustration, inspiring the founders to create a subscription-based model without late fees.

The subscription service gained traction, allowing users to rent DVDs online and have them delivered to their homes. By 1999, Netflix offered a flat-rate monthly subscription, providing an innovative approach to movie rentals. As technology advanced, they transitioned from DVDs to streaming, introducing "Watch Now" in 2007.

Netflix's streaming service quickly gained popularity, and they began producing original content, starting with "Lilyhammer" in 2012. The platform's original series like "House of Cards" and "Stranger Things" garnered widespread acclaim, positioning Netflix as a major player in the entertainment industry.

Over the years, Netflix expanded its reach globally, introducing localized content in various languages and regions. As of now, it stands as a household name, offering a vast array of movies, TV series, documentaries, and original productions to millions of subscribers worldwide, fundamentally changing the way people consume entertainment.
